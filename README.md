Needed python libraries:

tsplib95 (pip install tsplib95)
python=3.11
numpy
pip
ipykernel
matplotlib

Needed to run jupyter, load instances and for visuals.
Several important notebooks: 
    main - running different LS
    visualisation_ea - visualise generations of EA
    ea - basic playground for EAs (for debugging)
    batch_comparison -  IMPORTANT! running repeated experiments here, all LS and EAs
    asymetric -  brief experiments with asymetric problems

What to do?
Recomment to run batch_comparison.ipynb notebook . Load one problem, then select perturbs / inits and run cells each alg.
